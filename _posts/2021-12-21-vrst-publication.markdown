During my final year of university I produced a COVID-19 simulation taking place within a replica of the University of Derby's Markeaton campus. The user actively partakes in the simulation and is able to transmit the virus between themselves and AI agents. We decided to pursue a publication of this work, first attempting a paper submission, and then after the recommendation to, shortened down to a poster format. The work has been published and can be found on the [ACM website](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3489849.3489946).

I am rather happy that this work was published, and it was an interesting process turning a dissertation into a paper format, and then shortening to the poster. It was also a good opportunity to collaborate with others from the university.
