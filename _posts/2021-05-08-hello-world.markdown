This weekend I discovered that github pages allows for free web hosting as long as I use this specific site name. So now I've finally had more of a reason to set up a website, this may be used for a blog section but more importantly it will be used as a [portfolio](/portfolio/) of my work. The site has been relatively easy to get set up and running, I have used jekyll, github pages, and the minimal mistakes theme which has allowed me to get the structure set up right to then focus on the content to show on here, which now I should really get around to doing.
