The user actively partakes in the simulation and is able to transmit the virus between themselves and AI agents. We decided to pursue a publication of this work, first attempting a paper submission, and then after the recommendation to, shortened down to a poster format. The work has been published and can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3489849.3489946&quot;&gt;ACM website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am rather happy that this work was published, and it was an interesting process turning a dissertation into a paper format, and then shortening to the poster. It was also a good opportunity to collaborate with others from the university.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ryan Skull</name></author><summary type="html">During my final year of university I produced a COVID-19 simulation taking place within a replica of the University of Derby’s Markeaton campus.

The site has been relatively easy to get set up and running, I have used jekyll, github pages, and the minimal mistakes theme which has allowed me to get the structure set up right to then focus on the content to show on here, which now I should really get around to doing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ryan Skull</name></author><summary type="html">This weekend I discovered that github pages allows for free web hosting as long as I use this specific site name.
