# Profile
Early career programmer searching for a new exciting role. Recently completed university achieving a 1st, as well as being awarded with the dean’s prize for my dissertation project. Additionally, I received funding from the university to pursue a conference submission which was published as a poster as part of VRST 2021.

# Work Experience
## ITP Aero – Graduate Software Engineer (2021/06 – Present)
- Java, C++, and JNI sending data between Java and C++. Moved and implemented logic from Java to C++ allowing for C++ procedures that host the business logic, so they can be called from multiple frontends such as Java, and Python.
- Added and updated usage of Gtest, and JUnit unit testing frameworks.
- Performed code reviews, checking team members code follows standards as well as suggesting potential implementation changes.
- Written technical documentation for project implementation.
- Written and performed software verification plans.
- Acted as a mentor for a placement student, offering guidance and plans to tackle components.
- Worked in a team environment using git to share files on a project and then a different source control MKS, for more final revisions and issue tracking.

## University of Derby – Student Lab Assistant (2020/09 – 2021/05)
Helped a range of students with different programming related issues, aiding and teaching them how to resolve them. 

## ITP Aero – Industrial Placement Programmer (2019/06 – 2020/08)
- Roughly halved RAM requirements for large user models. Project focussed on removal of duplicate data between Java and C++, moving to a model where instead the data is stored C++ side, and then accessed via JNI when it is needed in Java.
- Overhauled C++ string generation system that recreates user models to be more readable.
- Made the software more stable by fixing numerous bugs between the Java and C++ side of the project, testing the bug fixes as I implemented them, often adding JUnit tests where possible.
- Produced code following a consistent code style for ease of readability between developers.
- Discovered helpful design patterns through exposure to them in the existing codebase, causing me to implement them in some of my personal work.

## Tesco – Checkouts, Grocery, and Warehouseman (2015/10 – 2019/06)
- Checkouts gave me the opportunity to talk to many people in a day, making myself much more open and confident with others.
- Grocery had me working as part of a team ensuring the shop floor is stocked and clean, communicating with the team to ensure we are evenly covering the shop.
- Co-ordinated with delivery drivers to ensure that the contents can be unloaded timely, with other colleagues joining the process where required.
- Proposed solutions to make the process of unloading delivery wagons quicker, which have been implemented successfully and shown to be effective.
- Managed time effectively between maintaining a tidy warehouse, clearing waste products, and unloading deliveries.

# Education
## University of Derby – Computer Games Programming with Industrial Placement (2017 – 2021)
- Throughout the course I have developed programming skills from a variety of modules, this has exposed myself to C, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, REST API, MySQL/PostgreSQL, and Unreal Engine. Whilst more heavily I have learned C++, C#, and Unity. 
- Learned many computer science fundamentals such as data structures, hex, binary, set math, vector math, matrix math, and human computer interaction regarding good design and harmful designs.
- Team based modules on the course have helped expose me to git and GitHub, using them to collaborate with other members, maintaining one source version.

## Earlier Education
- Chesterfield college (2016-2017), games and apps development. Achieved D*D*. Learned some basic programming fundamentals through Construct 2.
- Tupton Hall Sixth Form (2014 – 2016). A-level studies into mathematics, further mathematics, and physics.
- Tibshelf Secondary School (2009-2014). 8GCSE’s A*-D, with an A* in maths, B in English, and an A in triple sciences.

# Other Skills
- Team lead for final year game development project, involved setting up methods for the group of 9 to communicate effectively under work from home conditions such as Trello, and Discord, as well as leading group meetings.
- Developed a few personal game projects in Godot utilising GDScript a python like language.
- C# and Unity to develop personal game projects, learned to love some features of C# such as extension methods.
- Light understanding of Unity shader graph with the high-definition render pipeline
- Microsoft Access used to create forms, queries and reports connected to an SQL backend.
- C++ and win32 API calls to create a 3D wireframe renderer. Also used with directx11 for a game engine featuring terrain from a blend map and height map.
- Worked on projects during industrial work placement as part of a small team.
